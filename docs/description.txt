============
Buildout Tox
============

This is a buildout recipe to build and test packages in multiple
environments. It is inspired by Holger Krekel's excellent Tox__
package for virtualenv__ but focuses instead on package development
using buildout__.

__ http://www.virtualenv.org/
__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/1.5.2

.. warning:: 

  This package is not currently being developed and was never
  completed!

  The author discovered that Tox itself can be used with buildout and
  provides a good way of checking that package distributions contain
  what is required.

  For an example of this usage pattern, see the TestFixtures__
  package.
